This repo contains some interesting GADT code. Most codes are easy,  but some are probably quite complicated to you. Few may be even at jaw-dropping level...

GADT is used in the following way

1. enforcing invariants at compile-time so implementation is correct by guarantee

2. more powerful data structure, e.g., heterogeneous list

3. maybe more...
